# FDA-Tasks
**Fundamentals of Data Analysis Tasks 2020**

Four number tasks to be completed in the the Fundamentals of Data Analysis Module as part of the Higher Dipolma of Data Analytics Degree at GMIT.

Please refer to [assessment.pdf](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/FDA-Tasks/blob/main/assessment.pdf) included within this repository for a full description of the Fundamentals of Data Analysis tasks & objectives.

## Task 1 - COUNT Programme
*5th October 2020*

Program Overview:

Using jupyter notebook write a simple python function which takes in a list as a input and returns a dictonary of the items in the list as keys and counts the number of times the each item appears as values. 

## Task 2 - DiceRolls
*2nd November 2020*

Program Overview:

Using jupyter notebook write a python function that simulates rolling dice. The function will take an input for the number of dice rolled & the number of times the dice are rolled in the simulation, the function will count and record the sum of the rolled dice for each roll and provide a dictionary output of the results.

## Task 3 - CoinFlip
*16th November 2020*

Using jupyter notebook write some python code which simulates flipping a coin with a 50/50 chance of heads or tails a 100 times, the code should count & record the number of heads landed for each coin flip. The code should then repeat this process 1000 times, using an appropriate
plot the results of the coin flips should be depicted. It should be shown that the distribution of recorded heads landed for the coin fills will follow a bell-shaped curve. 

## Repository Files & Folders

List of files & folders contained within the Github Repository:

- Images folder - contains image files used within the Jupyter Notebook.
- .gitignore file -  specified to untrack .ipynb_checkpoints files.
- README.md - This README markdown file.
- Tasks Jupyter.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook file containing all the descriptive & programming objectives of the assessment tasks.
- assessment.pdf - full description of the Fundamentals of Data Analysis tasks & objectives.

## Jupyter Notebook

**Note:** all descriptive & programming objectives of the assessments have been fully complete within the interactive Jupyter Notebook environment, please refer to the [Tasks Jupyter.ipynb](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/FDA-Tasks/blob/main/Tasks%20Jupyter.ipynb) within this repository.

The notebook is assiocated with the Ipython kernal and therfore all code has been written & runs in Python.

##  Jupyter Notebook Environment

The jupyter notebook can be viewed as a static web page by opening the [Tasks Jupyter.ipynb](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/FDA-Tasks/blob/main/Tasks%20Jupyter.ipynb) file directly within this github repository. 

The fully interactive Jupyter notebook can be accessed via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com), the Python and R programming distribution which includes many data-science specific packages.

1. Download & install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
2. Create a local copy of the Github Repository on your computer, either by downloading the zip file of the repository or by using the Git Clone command, refer to [Github Cloning a Repository Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
3. Open the Anaconda Nagivator via the Windows Start Menu & launch the Jupyter Notebook web application or alternatively by opening terminal (cmd on Windows) & typing ``jupyter notebook``.
4. Within the Jupyter Notebook web application, nagivate to the folder location of the local copy of the repository & open the Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file.

**Cloud-Based Services**

Alternatively to downloading & installing  Anaconda & the Jupyter Notebook environment, cloud based servces such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) can be used to easily run a fully interactive Jupyter notebook in the cloud.

Google Colab is available to anyone with a Google account, it allows for quick creation of notebooks, uploading an existing notebook, or importing a notebook from any public GitHub repository, it comes with most of the commonly used Python libraries pre-installed.
