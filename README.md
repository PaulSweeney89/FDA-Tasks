**Fundamentals of Data Analysis Tasks 2020**

Four number tasks to be completed in the the Fundamentals of Data Analysis Module as part of the Higher Dipolma of Data Analytics Degree at GMIT.

Please refer to [assessment.pdf](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/FDA-Tasks/blob/main/assessment.pdf) included within this repository for a full description of the Fundamentals of Data Analysis tasks & objectives.

## Task 1 - COUNT Programme
*5th October 2020*

Program Overview:

Using jupyter notebook write a simple python function which takes in a list as a input and returns a dictonary of the items in the list as keys and counts the number of times the each item appears as values. 

## Task 2 - DiceRolls
*2nd November 2020*

Program Overview:

Using jupyter notebook write a python function that simulates rolling dice. The function will take an input for the number of dice rolled & the number of times the dice are rolled in the simulation, the function will count and record the sum of the rolled dice for each roll and provide a dictionary output of the results.

## Task 3 - CoinFlip
*16th November 2020*

Using jupyter notebook write some python code which simulates flipping a coin with a 50/50 chance of heads or tails a 100 times, the code should count & record the number of heads landed for each coin flip. The code should then repeat this process 1000 times, using an appropriate
plot the results of the coin flips should be depicted. It should be shown that the distribution of recorded heads landed for the coin fills will follow a bell-shaped curve. 

## Jupyter Notebook

**Note:** all descriptive & programming objectives of the assessments have been fully complete within the interactive Jupyter Notebook environment, please refer to the [Tasks Jupyter.ipynb](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/FDA-Tasks/blob/main/Tasks%20Jupyter.ipynb) within this repository.

The notebook is assiocated with the Ipython kernal and therfore all code has been written & runs in Python.
